  Woodpecker

= What is Woodpecker? =

Woodpecker is a SCSS compiler written in Python. Basically it is a
reimplementation of Sass: http://sass-lang.com

In addition, Woodpecker provides built-in support for all mixins and functions
provided by the Compass framework: http://compass-style.org


= How can I use Woodpecker? =

Currently? Not. It is still in an early stage of development.

But if you really want to try it out, please read on...


= Okay, I really want to try it out. How can I process my SCSS? =

Easy, just run the sass.py script and provide it with SCSS as standard input.

Example:

  cat stylesheet.scss | python sass.py


= Cool! And can it also minify the CSS output? =

Sure it can! Just provide the --minimize option.

Example:

  cat stylesheet.scss | python sass.py --minimize


= Great! But is there also an interactive mode? =

Well, as a matter of fact, yes there is! Just use the -i option.

Example:

  python sass.py -i

Note that the interactive console also processes expressions right now, so you
can't do variable assignments... yet.


= So, do you actually test this? =

Yep, there's a test suite included as well. It's in the test directory.

Try it out:

  python test_sass.py


= Can I also use it programmatically, as part of a build script for example? =

Actually, that's what it was intended for all along! I have no extensive
documentation for you, but it goes something like this:

  import cssparser
  import scsscompiler
  import scssimporter

  parser = cssparser.CSSParser()
  # provide some options you like to pass, for example:
  options = cssparser.CSSOptions(stripWhiteSpace = True, stripComments = True,
                                 minimizeValues = True, stripExtraSemicolons = True,
                                 colorize = False, compileScss = True)
  styleSheet = parser.parse(inputString, options)

  scssimporter.Importer.addPath("other/woodpecker/stylesheets") # to get the Compass
                                                                # imports to work
  compiler = scsscompiler.SCSSCompiler()
  compiler.compile(styleSheet, options)
  outputString = styleSheet.toString(options)


= Thanks so much! I'll eagerly await your final release! =

My pleasure! And if you have any comments or suggestions, just let me know!
